The **DISC phonemic alphabet** represents speech sounds by creating a one-to-one mapping between sounds and symbols, much like the IPA.
_Unlike_ the IPA, the DISC phonemic alphabet only uses symbols that appear on a standard keyboard.
APLS uses a subset of DISC relevant to North American Englishes.

In APLS, we use DISC symbols for **phonemic** representations of sounds, not **phonetic** representations.
As a result, the APLS subset of DISC doesn't have symbols for [ɾ] or [ʔ]; in North American Englishes, these surface only as allophones of /t/.

## Transcribing words using DISC

As noted above, DISC transcription is phonemic rather than phonetic.
Here are some other things to note:

- Monophthongs before /ɹ/ should always be transcribed with the DISC `r` symbol (see examples [above](#monophthongs-before-r))
	- Exception: the speaker cuts off the word before an /ɹ/ (e.g., cutting off _start_ as `sta~[st#]`
- IPA makes a distinction between _stressed_ central vowels /ʌ ɝ/ and _unstressed_ central vowels /ə ɚ/. Similiarly, use DISC `V`/`3r` for _stressed_ vowels and `@`/`@r` for _unstressed_ vowels
	- Exception: Always use `3r` for _-burg(h)_, even if it's unstressed (e.g., _Pittsburghese_ is `pItsb3rgiz` not *`pItsb@rgiz`)
- Use the DISC symbols for syllabic consonants, `F`/`H`/`P`, rather than `@m`/`@n`/`@l` (see examples [above](#disc-consonants))
	- Exception: Don't use syllabic consonants for onsets (e.g., _Panera_ is `p@n8r@`, not *`pH8r@`)
- For word-final high front vowels, use `i` rather than `I` (i.e., we assume universal [_happy_-tensing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonological_history_of_English_close_front_vowels#Happy-tensing))
- When /ŋ/ comes before a vowel or syllabic consonant, assume it's followed by /g/ (e.g., _dangle_ is `d{NgP`, not *`d{NP`)
- Don't forget that _nk_ in English spelling is usually /ŋk/ (DISC `Nk`) rather than /nk/ (DISC `nk`)
- For "schwi", use `@` rather than `I` (e.g., _breathless_ is `brETl@s` not *`brETlIs`)
- If you have the _cot_–_caught_ merger in production and/or perception, ask a non-merged friend to help you decide whether to transcribe `Q` or `$`.


## Suggesting new dictionary entries

APLS uses two sources to look up phonemic representations: (1) the Unisyn English dictionary (which is supposed to be a universal English dictionary), and (2) a [custom dictionary](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/djvill/APLS/main/files/custom-dictionary/aplsDict.txt).
Occasionnally you'll run across a word that needs to be added to APLS's custom dictionary.
Most often this will be a Pittsburgh/western PA geographic name (e.g., neighborhoods like _Shadyside_, municipalities like _Sewickley_, streets like _Baum_), a brand name (e.g., _Highmark_, _Panera_), or a Pittsburgh lexical feature (e.g., _redd_, _gumband_).
However, there are words that aren't Pittsburgh-specific that are absent from Unisyn, sometimes unexpectedly;
for example, we've had to manually add entries for _artsy_, _bachelorette_, _homie_, _Kwanzaa_, _microbrew_, _stepdad_, _tarp_, and _y'all_ (among others).

Everything from the previous sections apply to new words that you suggest for the custom dictionary, plus the following:

1. If applicable, you can suggest 2+ phonemic representations per word (but this is optional)
1. Add symbols to mark syllabification and stress


### Multiple phonemic representations

APLS's custom dictionary can contain multiple phonemic representations for any given word.
For example, the first vowel in _Lawrenceville_ can rhyme with either _shore_ or _far_ (`$r` or `#r`).
In that case, just suggest the full DISC representation twice: `'l$r-Hs-"vIl` or `'l#r-Hs-"vIl`


### Syllabification and stress

Use the following symbols for syllabification and stress **only** if suggesting new entries for the APLS custom dictionary (not for DISC transcription in pronounce codes):

<div id="syll-table">

| DISC | Function          |
|------|-------------------|
|   -  | Syllable boundary |
|   '  | Primary stress    |
|   "  | Secondary stress  |

</div>

For example, _Pennsylvanian_ is `"pEn-sP-'v1n-jH`. 
Stress markers go before any other DISC symbols, but (if applicable) after the syllable boundary.
Unstressed syllables get no stress markers.

A few finer points:

- Every complete word has one primary-stressed syllable. _Incomplete_ words with hesitations might not have a primary-stressed syllable, but the APLS custom dictionary won't have incomplete words
	- Most words don't have secondary stress
- Use secondary stress for city-name morphemes _-burg(h)_, _-ville_, _-vale_, _-dale_, _-town_, etc.
	- Exception: There are derivational affixes that change the stress pattern (e.g., _Pittsburghese_ is `"pIts-b3r-'giz`)
- Intervocalic consonants should be syllabified as onsets rather than codas (e.g., 
	- Exception 1: Intervocalic /ɹ/ should be syllabified as a coda (e.g., _Panera_ is `p@-'n8r-@` not *`p@-'n8-r@`)
	- Exception 2: In environments where prevocalic /t/ becomes [ʔ] (e.g., before /n̩/) should be syllabified as a coda (e.g., _outen_ is `'6t-H` not *`'6-tH`)
