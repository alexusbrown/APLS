# APLS

Dan Villarreal, University of Pittsburgh Linguistics

This repository holds information for users of the [Archive of Pittsburgh Language and Speech](https://labb-cat.linguistics.pitt.edu/labbcat/) aka APLS (pronounced like _apples_).

It includes a few public-facing pages hosted via GitHub Pages (aka github.io): the [APLS transcription convention](https://djvill.github.io/APLS/doc/Transcription-Convention.html) and [phonemic transcription with DISC](https://djvill.github.io/APLS/doc/Phonemic-Transcription.html).

This repository (unlike APLS itself) is licensed CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.

This repo is still very much a work in progress.
However, I anticipate it'll contain info for not only end-users, but also transcribers and even corpus maintainers.
