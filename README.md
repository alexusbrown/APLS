This repository holds information for users of the [Archive of Pittsburgh Language and Speech](https://labb-cat.linguistics.pitt.edu/labbcat/) aka APLS (pronounced like _apples_).

This repository (unlike APLS itself) is licensed CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.

This repo is still very much a work in progress.
However, I anticipate it'll contain info for not only end-users, but also transcribers and even corpus maintainers.
