# Archive of Pittsburgh Language and Speech (APLS)

[![](https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-sa/4.0/88x31.png)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)

This GitHub repository hosts documentation and files for users of the **Archive of Pittsburgh Language and Speech** aka **APLS** (pronounced like _apples_).
It powers the webpage <djvill.github.io/APLS>, which is hosted by GitHub Pages.
This repository (unlike APLS itself) is licensed CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.


If you're looking for the APLS homepage, please visit <apls.pitt.edu>.
The APLS corpus is at <apls.pitt.edu/labbcat>.
This README page describes the repository itself, which may be of interest to developers.


This repo is still very much a work in progress.
However, I anticipate it'll contain info for not only end-users, but also transcribers and corpus maintainers.
